# Movie_Trailers

There are some of my favorite movies and shows here. You'll be able to watch the trailers and read a bit of the video description when you hover over the images. You should be able to horizontally scroll through the movie list.

As it states in the movie site, there's going to be more site updates.

The plan for this website is to be a fully functioning streaming site. But for now, enjoy the movie/series suggestions. STAY TUNED!!!

For this project, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Google API for fonts, and YouTube's API to host the movie and TV trailers.
